# The Warbler's Nest

This repository contains the source and skein files of _The Warbler's Nest_, an interactive fiction by Jason McIntosh. The author shares them in order to provide those interested in Inform with a complete, ready-to-compile example of non-trivial scope.

If you just want to _play_ the game, you don't want to be here. [Visit the game's homepage instead.](http://jmac.org/warbler)

## About the game

[_The Warbler's Nest_] was originally written as an entry to the 2010 [interactive fiction competition](http://ifcomp.org). Since then it won 2010's [XYZZY Award](http://xyzzyawards.org) for Best Story, and [has been commercially adapted to iOS](http://orangepeelgames.com/the-warblers-nest.html) by way of [Andrew Plotkin's IosFizmo](https://github.com/erkyrath/iosfizmo). 

The game is quite short, taking perhaps about half an hour for an experienced player to explore thoroughly. Obviously, the author recommends that you [play the game](http://jmac.org/warbler) at least once before reading the source code.

## About the code

This code is not beautiful or well organized. The author learned Inform 7 while writing this game, and shipped the game's first version before reading [a book about Inform 7 best practices](http://inform7.textories.com).

That said, it works, and demonstrates various (though by no means all) key features of the Inform language and development system. This includes a complete skein file that acts as an effective regression-test suite for the game, leading its automated player down every significant story-path. 

## Making it go

First, download and install the latest version of [Inform](http://inform7.com) in a matter befitting your computer. Then open `warbler.inform` with Inform. Poof, you should see the story's source code in the Inform IDE. Hitting the IDE's __Go!__ button should, indeed, compile the game and make it go.

Then, I suppose, you'll want to proceed to mess around with the code and see what happens in the game world as you do so. Have fun!
