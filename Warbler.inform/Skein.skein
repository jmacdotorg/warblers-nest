Surely the reed bank counts as a wild place. While it gives you so much, you&apos;ve never tended it, not really, not like you do with your garden. And you&apos;ve certainly seen birds there. It&apos;s something like the forest, then, but much safer to search without attracting attention. So here you are.

Remembering, you look at the sky, reflexively.

Today the sky is a uniform middling gray. Overcast.

You part the reeds nearest you and peer at the marshy ground underneath them, but find nothing useful.

A space in front of your home, long ago cleared from the reed bank to the south. You can see the road from here, and of course the forest beyond it.

Your garden lies here, good earth and green, a row of stones marking it off.

Behind your cottage
Another small clearing behind your cottage. You do not come here very often, or anyway not lately.

You could wander back into the reeds to the south, or return to your garden by walking northwest or southwest around your home. The road lies to the north, where it runs east, vanishing into the dark wood.

The forest also looms to the east of where you now stand. An old fallen log reaches out of it, into the clearing.

Two standing stones mark the earth here, along the rear wall of the cottage. One, waist-high, stands larger than the other.

You hear that snuffling noise again, from somewhere very near.

You could wander back into the reeds to the south, or return to your garden by walking northwest or southwest around your home. The road lies to the north, where it runs east, vanishing into the dark wood.

The forest also looms to the east of where you now stand. An old fallen log reaches out of it, into the clearing.

Two standing stones mark the earth here, along the rear wall of the cottage. One, waist-high, stands larger than the other.

You could wander back into the reeds to the south, or return to your garden by walking northwest or southwest around your home. The road lies to the north, where it runs east, vanishing into the dark wood.

The forest also looms to the east of where you now stand. An old fallen log reaches out of it, into the clearing.

Two standing stones mark the earth here, along the rear wall of the cottage. One, waist-high, stands larger than the other.

Behind the trunk, a stoat dines noisily on a stolen bird&apos;s egg, unaware of your presence.

Something alive.

The tailor gestured to some mushrooms growing near your garden. &quot;Fairy ring,&quot; he said. &quot;These grow where they gather and dance, in the forest, and also where they mean to meddle, in the places we live.&quot; Looking again, yes, the mushrooms did seem to have a sort of circular pattern to them.

&quot;You musn&apos;t let them grow so near your home like this, first of all,&quot; he said, &quot;as it makes them bolder.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; you said, unsure why his voice seemed so heavy with concern. &quot;I can just treat them like the weeds in the garden, then.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; he said, and paused before looking at you again.

A small bulge of sandy beach, providing a place to stand comfortably and access the river water clear of the reeds. The river to the south curves gently around it.

The river flows here, as it always has, clear and cool.

Outside the cottage
A space in front of your home, long ago cleared from the reed bank to the south. You can see the road from here, and of course the forest beyond it.

Your garden lies here, good earth and green, a row of stones marking it off.

The doorway to your cottage is to the east. You could also walk around the cottage, to the northeast or the southeast, towards the little clearing you know is there.

Silence, especially strange for this time of day, sits heavily in the clearing.

Just as you step free of the reeds, the cracked eggshell in your hand gives way. In two eyeblinks, it collapses on itself, the water spilling between your fingers and the broken pieces of shell tumbling to the earth, useless now.

You look up, then, to the doorway of your cottage. Well. You held two full eggs. Maybe that was enough?

Maybe it had better be enough.

Maybe it&apos;s getting late (another reflexive look at the sky, still gray as ever), and maybe you are in the middle of something you don&apos;t fully ken, brought about by a man who isn&apos;t even here, and maybe you should bring an end to this before it gets any later.

Here is where you&apos;ve lived for so many years, a cottage much like any other, a fine place to rest after a day gathering reeds or preparing thatch. Here you have made meals beyond counting, always for yourself, sometimes for another. It contains scattered furniture -- the largest being a table against one wall, and a cradle not far from it.

But right now, all your attention is on the chair.

Yes.

You step back and look at the baby, at its face. Yes, its features are all twisted up by its crying, and yes, maybe they&apos;re a little strange just the same.

But the deeper resemblance is undeniable. Part of you wants to curse his cowardice for suggesting that it was any other way. But, there will be time for that later.

The rest of you, the whole of your heart, reaches out to the child. You know, as sure as the day it was born, that it -- that he -- is truly yours.

You could wander back into the reeds to the south, or return to your garden by walking northwest or southwest around your home. The road lies to the north, where it runs east, vanishing into the dark wood.

The forest also looms to the east of where you now stand. An old fallen log reaches out of it, into the clearing.

Two standing stones mark the earth here, along the rear wall of the cottage. One, waist-high, stands larger than the other.

Behind the trunk, a stoat dines noisily on a stolen bird&apos;s egg, unaware of your presence.

But: You do hear a soft sound, unfamiliar, coming from the space behind your cottage.

Something alive.

The tailor gestured to some mushrooms growing near your garden. &quot;Fairy ring,&quot; he said. &quot;These grow where they gather and dance, in the forest, and also where they mean to meddle, in the places we live.&quot; Looking again, yes, the mushrooms did seem to have a sort of circular pattern to them.

&quot;You musn&apos;t let them grow so near your home like this, first of all,&quot; he said, &quot;as it makes them bolder.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; you said, unsure why his voice seemed so heavy with concern. &quot;I can just treat them like the weeds in the garden, then.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; he said, and paused before looking at you again.

Your garden lies here, good earth and green, a row of stones marking it off.

The doorway to your cottage is to the east. You could also walk around the cottage, to the northeast or the southeast, towards the little clearing you know is there.

Silence, especially strange for this time of day, sits heavily in the clearing.

Among the reeds
The familiar reed bank behind your cottage surrounds you, filling the damp space between your home and the river to the south.

Under the nest is a small mound of feathers, straw, droppings, and other matter apparently dropped from the reed-bird&apos;s nest and its occupant.

A small, spotted egg lies on the ground underneath the nest.

One particularly tall stalk, topped with an early flower, marks the location of the reed bird&apos;s nest.

Holding it, you now see that the egg&apos;s surface is webbed with cracks, as if it had been dropped.

&quot;Once you&apos;ve found those eggshells,&quot; the tailor continued, &quot;what you do is -- this sounds strange, but that&apos;s the whole point, see -- you need to fill them up with water. Then you carry them, one in each hand, like they&apos;re the heaviest buckets, you carry them right back into your cottage, and you show them to him.&quot;

He paused then, but you only nodded, unsure what to say to all this.

&quot;You musn&apos;t let them grow so near your home like this, first of all,&quot; he said, &quot;as it makes them bolder.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; you said, unsure why his voice seemed so heavy with concern. &quot;I can just treat them like the weeds in the garden, then.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; he said, and paused before looking at you again.

The familiar reed bank behind your cottage surrounds you, filling the damp space between your home and the river to the south.

One particularly tall stalk, topped with an early flower, marks the location of the reed bird&apos;s nest.

The chick, now fed, resettles itself atop the nest, preening a bit. As it does so, loose feathers and other bits of refuse drift down to join a pile on the ground beneath it.
