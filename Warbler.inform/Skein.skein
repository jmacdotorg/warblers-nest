Surely the reed bank counts as a wild place. While it gives you so much, you&apos;ve never tended it, not really, not like you do with your garden. And you&apos;ve certainly seen birds there. It&apos;s something like the forest, then, but much safer to search without attracting attention. So here you are.

The doorway to your cottage is to the east. You could also walk around the cottage, to the northeast or the southeast, towards the little clearing you know is there.

You could wander back into the reeds to the south, or return to your garden by walking northwest or southwest around your home. The road lies to the north, where it runs east, vanishing into the dark wood.

The forest also looms to the east of where you now stand. An old fallen log reaches out of it, into the clearing.

Two standing stones mark the earth here, along the rear wall of the cottage. One, waist-high, stands larger than the other.

You hear that snuffling noise again, from somewhere very near.

You see it. A skinny little man, wearing a... a fur coat, and a spotted cap? It&apos;s lying down, right in the center of the fairy ring, damn it all, and its tail twitches as it... oh.

You let go the breath you hadn&apos;t realized you were holding. No, it&apos;s not a little man. Though it is another sort of forest creature, true enough, and maybe no less wicked, in its way.

The little animal isn&apos;t so absorbed in its meal that it doesn&apos;t hear you approach. It pulls its head from the egg to regard you just as you draw near. Then, quick as a flash, it&apos;s gone, swallowed up by the forest.

It has left its egg behind.

You pick up the eggshell from where the little animal left it.

&quot;Once you&apos;ve found those eggshells,&quot; the tailor continued, &quot;what you do is -- this sounds strange, but that&apos;s the whole point, see -- you need to fill them up with water. Then you carry them, one in each hand, like they&apos;re the heaviest buckets, you carry them right back into your cottage, and you show them to him.&quot;

He paused then, but you only nodded, unsure what to say to all this.

A space in front of your home, long ago cleared from the reed bank to the south. You can see the road from here, and of course the forest beyond it.

The doorway to your cottage is to the east. You could also walk around the cottage, to the northeast or the southeast, towards the little clearing you know is there.

Silence, especially strange for this time of day, sits heavily in the clearing.

You could wander back into the reeds to the south, or return to your garden by walking northwest or southwest around your home. The road lies to the north, where it runs east, vanishing into the dark wood.

The forest also looms to the east of where you now stand. An old fallen log reaches out of it, into the clearing.

Two standing stones mark the earth here, along the rear wall of the cottage. One, waist-high, stands larger than the other.

You see it. A skinny little man, wearing a... a fur coat, and a spotted cap? It&apos;s lying down, right in the center of the fairy ring, damn it all, and its tail twitches as it... oh.

You let go the breath you hadn&apos;t realized you were holding. No, it&apos;s not a little man. Though it is another sort of forest creature, true enough, and maybe no less wicked, in its way.

And that &quot;cap&quot; does catch your attention...

Heedless of your standing there, the stoat continues lapping noisily at the spotted egg, its paws grasping the shell.

The little animal isn&apos;t so absorbed in its meal that it doesn&apos;t hear you approach. It pulls its head from the egg to regard you just as you draw near. Then, quick as a flash, it&apos;s gone, swallowed up by the forest.

It has left its egg behind.

You pick up the eggshell from where the little animal left it.

&quot;Once you&apos;ve found those eggshells,&quot; the tailor continued, &quot;what you do is -- this sounds strange, but that&apos;s the whole point, see -- you need to fill them up with water. Then you carry them, one in each hand, like they&apos;re the heaviest buckets, you carry them right back into your cottage, and you show them to him.&quot;

He paused then, but you only nodded, unsure what to say to all this.

A space in front of your home, long ago cleared from the reed bank to the south. You can see the road from here, and of course the forest beyond it.

The doorway to your cottage is to the east. You could also walk around the cottage, to the northeast or the southeast, towards the little clearing you know is there.

Silence, especially strange for this time of day, sits heavily in the clearing.

Maybe it&apos;s getting late (another reflexive look at the sky, still gray as ever), and maybe you are in the middle of something you don&apos;t fully ken, brought about by a man who isn&apos;t even here, and maybe you should bring an end to this before it gets any later.

Inside your cottage
Here is where you&apos;ve lived for so many years, a cottage much like any other, a fine place to rest after a day gathering reeds or preparing thatch. Here you have made meals beyond counting, always for yourself, sometimes for another. It contains scattered furniture -- the largest being a table against one wall, and a cradle not far from it.

But right now, all your attention is on the chair.

&quot;I&apos;ve heard different things,&quot; said the tailor, &quot;but they all agree that changelings can&apos;t abide humans acting strange, and using eggshells in a weird way will always set them off. When a changeling sees such a thing, it can&apos;t help but to leap up and declare, &apos;Crikey! I&apos;m two hundred years old, and I&apos;ve never seen anything queer as that!&apos; Or something of the sort, anyway. And that&apos;s how you know you&apos;ve got a changeling.&quot;

&quot;But what would I do then?&quot; you asked.

&quot;Once it&apos;s revealed itself to you? That&apos;s simple,&quot; said the tailor. &quot;Snatch it up, carry it out of your cottage, and throw it in the river. Throw it into the river, and its own kind will come for it. Then they&apos;ll have to return what they took from you.&quot;

The baby looks right at the eggshell with its dark, dull eyes. Then it opens its mouth.

&quot;Cuh,&quot; it says. &quot;C-cuh... Cruh...&quot;

&quot;And if the baby isn&apos;t a changeling?&quot; you asked.

&quot;Well,&quot; said the tailor, with a smile. &quot;I suppose it won&apos;t say anything at all!&quot;

&quot;Cuh... k-kkaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUAAAAAAUUAAA...&quot;

The baby begins howling, just as it has been, most every day, and most of every day. For so long.

But... it didn&apos;t start until it saw the eggshell, this time. Does that mean something? Did it... did it work?

What happens now?

Here is where you&apos;ve lived for so many years, a cottage much like any other, a fine place to rest after a day gathering reeds or preparing thatch. Here you have made meals beyond counting, always for yourself, sometimes for another. It contains scattered furniture -- the largest being a table against one wall, and a cradle not far from it.

A pair of iron shears lies on the table, wedged open.

The baby sits on the chair, held upright by the blanket you&apos;d tied before you began your search.

&quot;...Oh,&quot; you say again, louder. &quot;I have brought back the whole river for the potage, and it is such a heavy thing! Do you see?&quot;

You then lift up the eggshell, straining, as if it were a pail, filled to spilling.

&quot;I&apos;ve heard different things,&quot; said the tailor, &quot;but they all agree that changelings can&apos;t abide humans acting strange, and using eggshells in a weird way will always set them off. When a changeling sees such a thing, it can&apos;t help but to leap up and declare, &apos;Crikey! I&apos;m two hundred years old, and I&apos;ve never seen anything queer as that!&apos; Or something of the sort, anyway. And that&apos;s how you know you&apos;ve got a changeling.&quot;

&quot;But what would I do then?&quot; you asked.

&quot;Once it&apos;s revealed itself to you? That&apos;s simple,&quot; said the tailor. &quot;Snatch it up, carry it out of your cottage, and throw it in the river. Throw it into the river, and its own kind will come for it. Then they&apos;ll have to return what they took from you.&quot;

The baby looks right at the eggshell with its dark, dull eyes. Then it opens its mouth.

It is a monster, a creature of the forest, come to play you for a fool, and it did. For a while. But God bless that tailor for knowing what to do.

And now you know what you have to do, too.
Maybe it would feel good to make the vile little thing pay for all it&apos;s taken from you. But you know that&apos;s not the proper way to dispose of this creature, and the cost would be too high. Leaving aside the question of whether it&apos;s a mortal sin to kill a changeling, it&apos;s doubtful you&apos;d see your real child again.

There&apos;s a better way.

The changeling shrieks and cries.

It was a hard birth. Not like the last one, but hard. Still, it ended with you holding the babe in your arms. Without words to describe how you felt, what you said was this:

Anda.

You really hadn&apos;t thought of a name before now, and all at once it seemed strange that you hadn&apos;t, though you hadn&apos;t really anyone to talk to about it. But at that moment you knew it was the right name. Anda, you said again.

The blanket now lies raggedly open on the chair, with the baby sitting atop it.

Just listen to it, you think to yourself, and catch yourself almost laughing, giddily. As if you&apos;ve had any choice but to listen, all this time!

It is a monster, a creature of the forest, come to play you for a fool, and it did. For a while. But God bless that tailor for knowing what to do.

And now you know what you have to do, too.

You wonder how the exchange will happen. Perhaps they already know that their trick is ended, and they will be waiting for you with your real baby. Or maybe you&apos;ll come back home to find him asleep in the crib; you&apos;re rather sure you&apos;ve heard of that happening before. Either way, they&apos;ll have to return him, once you throw their false child back to them. That&apos;s simply how it works.

The little animal isn&apos;t so absorbed in its meal that it doesn&apos;t hear you approach. It pulls its head from the egg to regard you just as you draw near. Then, quick as a flash, it&apos;s gone, swallowed up by the forest.

It has left its egg behind.

You pick up the eggshell from where the little animal left it.

&quot;Once you&apos;ve found those eggshells,&quot; the tailor continued, &quot;what you do is -- this sounds strange, but that&apos;s the whole point, see -- you need to fill them up with water. Then you carry them, one in each hand, like they&apos;re the heaviest buckets, you carry them right back into your cottage, and you show them to him.&quot;

    <commentary xml:space="preserve">(the speckled eggshell)
The little animal isn&apos;t so absorbed in its meal that it doesn&apos;t hear you approach. It pulls its head from the egg to regard you just as you draw near. Then, quick as a flash, it&apos;s gone, swallowed up by the forest.

It has left its egg behind.

You pick up the eggshell from where the little animal left it.

&quot;Once you&apos;ve found those eggshells,&quot; the tailor continued, &quot;what you do is -- this sounds strange, but that&apos;s the whole point, see -- you need to fill them up with water. Then you carry them, one in each hand, like they&apos;re the heaviest buckets, you carry them right back into your cottage, and you show them to him.&quot;

He paused then, but you only nodded, unsure what to say to all this.

A space in front of your home, long ago cleared from the reed bank to the south. You can see the road from here, and of course the forest beyond it.

Your garden lies here, good earth and green, a row of stones marking it off.

The doorway to your cottage is to the east. You could also walk around the cottage, to the northeast or the southeast, towards the little clearing you know is there.

Silence, especially strange for this time of day, sits heavily in the clearing.

Another small clearing behind your cottage. You do not come here very often, or anyway not lately.

You could wander back into the reeds to the south, or return to your garden by walking northwest or southwest around your home. The road lies to the north, where it runs east, vanishing into the dark wood.

The forest also looms to the east of where you now stand. An old fallen log reaches out of it, into the clearing.

Two standing stones mark the earth here, along the rear wall of the cottage. One, waist-high, stands larger than the other.

You let go the breath you hadn&apos;t realized you were holding. No, it&apos;s not a little man. Though it is another sort of forest creature, true enough, and maybe no less wicked, in its way.

The doorway to your cottage is to the east. You could also walk around the cottage, to the northeast or the southeast, towards the little clearing you know is there.

The chick, now fed, resettles itself atop the nest, preening a bit. As it does so, loose feathers and other bits of refuse drift down to join a pile on the ground beneath it.
